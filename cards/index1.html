                The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and
                working outward is
                the following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and
                then the
                possible Planet Nine.
  
                Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning that the solar
                system has
                nine planets. That all changed in the late 1990s when astronomers started arguing
                about
                whether Pluto was indeed a planet. In a highly controversial decision, the
                International
                Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to designate Pluto as a "dwarf
                planet,"
                reducing the list of the solar system's true planets to just eight.
  
                If you insist on including Pluto, it would come after Neptune on the list. Pluto
                is truly way
                out there and on a wildly tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it
                was
                demoted).

            Astronomers, however, are still hunting for another possible planet in our solar
            system, a
            true ninth planet, after mathematical evidence of its existence was revealed on Jan.
            20,
            2016. The alleged "Planet Nine," also called "Planet X," is believed to be about 10
            times the
            mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.
