                     <p>
                        The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and
                        working outward is
                        the following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and
                        then the
                        possible Planet Nine.
                        Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning that the solar
                        system has
                        nine planets. That all changed in the late 1990s when astronomers started arguing
                        about
                        whether Pluto was indeed a planet. In a highly controversial decision, the
                        International
                        Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to designate Pluto as a "dwarf
                        planet,"
                        reducing the list of the solar system's true planets to just eight.

                        If you insist on including Pluto, it would come after Neptune on the list. Pluto
                        is truly way
                        out there and on a wildly tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it
                        was
                        demoted).
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>
                        Astronomers, however, are still hunting for another possible planet in our solar
                        system, a
                        true ninth planet, after mathematical evidence of its existence was revealed on Jan.
                        20,
                        2016. The alleged "Planet Nine," also called "Planet X," is believed to be about 10
                        times the
                        mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it, including
                        planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. It extends from the sun, called Sol by the
                        ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner planets, through the Asteroid Belt to the four
                        gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the teardrop-shaped
                        heliopause. Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion miles
                        (15 billion kilometers) from the sun. Beyond the heliopause lies the giant, spherical Oort
                        Cloud, which is thought to surround the solar system.

                              <h4>HOW WAS THE SOLAR SYSTEM DISCOVERED?</h4>
                              <p>

                                 For millennia, astronomers have followed points of light that seemed to move among the
                                 stars.
                                 The ancient Greeks named them planets, meaning "wanderers." Mercury, Venus, Mars,
                                 Jupiter and
                                 Saturn were known in antiquity, and the invention of the telescope added the Asteroid
                                 Belt,
                                 Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and many of these worlds' moons. The dawn of the space age saw
                                 dozens
                                 of probes launched to explore our system, an adventure that continues today.

                                 There have been five human-made objects so far, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, New Horizons,
                                 Pioneer
                                 10 and Pioneer 11, that have crossed the threshold into interstellar space.
                                 The discovery of Eris kicked off a rash of new discoveries of dwarf planets, and
                                 eventually
                                 led to the International Astronomical Union revising the definition of a "planet." The
                                 revision changed Pluto's status from planet to dwarf planet in 2006, a decision that
                                 remains
                                 controversial – especially after the New Horizons mission found immense geological
                                 variety on
                                 the world in 2015.

                                 Astronomers are now hunting for another planet in our solar system, a true ninth
                                 planet,
                                 after evidence of its existence was unveiled on Jan. 20, 2016. The so-called "Planet
                                 Nine,"
                                 as scientists are calling it, is about 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun as
                                 close
                                 as 200 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance from Earth to the sun — about 93
                                 million miles (150 million km).

                              <h4>HOW DID THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORM?</h4>
                              <p>

                                 Many scientists think our solar system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and
                                 dust
                                 known as the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun
                                 faster and
                                 flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the
                                 sun.
                                 Other particles within the disk collided and stuck together to form asteroid-sized
                                 objects
                                 named as planetesimals, some of which combined to become the asteroids, comets, moons
                                 and
                                 planets.

                                 The solar wind from the sun was so powerful that it swept away most of the lighter
                                 elements,
                                 such as hydrogen and helium, from the innermost planets, leaving behind mostly small,
                                 rocky
                                 worlds. The solar wind was much weaker in the outer regions, however, resulting in gas
                                 giants
                                 made up mostly of hydrogen and helium.

                                 The sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of the solar
                                 system's mass. It sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth
                                 and
                                 possibly elsewhere. Planets orbit the sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with
                                 the sun
                                 slightly off-center of each ellipse. NASA has a fleet of spacecraft observing the sun,
                                 such
                                 as the Parker Solar Probe, to learn more about its composition, and to make better
                                 predictions about solar activity and its effect on Earth.

                              <p>

                                 The four inner four planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are made up mostly of
                                 iron and
                                 rock. They are known as terrestrial or earth-like planets because of their similar size
                                 and
                                 composition. Earth has one natural satellite — the moon — and Mars has two moons —
                                 Deimos and
                                 Phobos.

                                 Between Mars and Jupiter lies the Asteroid Belt. Asteroids are minor planets, and
                                 scientists
                                 estimate there are more than 750,000 of them with diameters larger than three-fifths of
                                 a
                                 mile (1 km) and millions of smaller asteroids. The dwarf planet Ceres, about 590 miles
                                 (950
                                 km) in diameter, resides here. A number of asteroids have orbits that take them closer
                                 into
                                 the solar system that sometimes lead them to collide with Earth or the other inner
                                 planets.

                                 Earth is surrounded by a flotilla of spacecraft, and Mars has been visited by many
                                 spacecraft
                                 as well. Some of the more prominent Martian missions include the Perseverance rover,
                                 InSight
                                 lander, Tianwen-1 rover, Curiosity rover, the Opportunity and Spirit rovers, the Mars
                                 Reconnaissance Orbiter (which takes high-resolution pictures from orbit) and the Viking
                                 landers and rovers.
                                 Venus has been explored by American, European and Soviet spacecraft, such as Venera 13
                                 over
                                 the decades. NASA announced in June 2021 that it will launch two missions to Venus by
                                 2030 -
                                 an orbiter called VERITAS and an atmospheric probe called DAVINCI+.

                                 Mercury has been host to several flybys and two-long term missions: MESSENGER (now
                                 concluded)

                              <h4>OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM</h4>

                              <p>
                                 The outer planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — are giant worlds with thick
                                 outer
                                 layers of gas. Between these planets, they have dozens of moons with a variety of
                                 compositions, ranging from rocky to icy to even volcanic (such as in the case of
                                 Jupiter's
                                 Io.) Nearly all the planets' mass is made up of hydrogen and helium, giving them
                                 compositions
                                 like that of the sun. Beneath these outer layers, they have no solid surfaces — the
                                 pressure
                                 from their thick atmospheres liquefy their insides, although they might have rocky
                                 cores.
                                 Rings of dust, rock, and ice encircle all these giants, with Saturn's being the most
                                 famous.

                                 Comets are often known as dirty snowballs, and consist mainly of ice and rock. When a
                                 comet's
                                 orbit takes it close to the sun, some of the ice in its central nucleus turns into gas
                                 that
                                 shoots out of the comet's sunlit side, which the solar wind carries outward to form
                                 into a
                                 long tail. Short-period comets that complete their orbits in less than 200 years are
                                 thought
                                 to originate from the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt, while long-period comets that take more
                                 than
                                 200 years to return are thought to come from the spherical Oort Cloud.

                                 Jupiter and Saturn have each been visited by several spacecraft, and were also host to
                                 long-term missions including Juno and Galileo at Jupiter, and Cassini at Saturn. Uranus
                                 and
                                 Neptune, however, have only been seen during one spacecraft flyby — that of Voyager 2
                                 in the
                                 1980s. Some scientists are working on creating a Uranus or Neptune orbiter to fly there
                                 in
                                 the 2030s or so. Scientists do observations from the ground as well, to track the
                                 long-term
                                 changes in weather and cloud formations in the gas giants.

                              Astronomers had long suspected that a band of icy material known as the Kuiper Belt
                              existed
                              past the orbit of Neptune extending from about 30 to 55 times the distance of Earth to the
                              sun, and from the last decade of the 20th century up to now, they have found more than a
                              thousand of such objects. Scientists estimate the Kuiper Belt is likely home to hundreds
                              of
                              thousands of icy bodies larger than 60 miles (100 km) wide, as well as an estimated
                              trillion
                              or more comets.

                              Pluto, now considered a dwarf planet, dwells in the Kuiper Belt. It is not alone — recent
                              additions include Makemake, Haumea and Eris. Another Kuiper Belt object dubbed Quaoar is
                              probably massive enough to be considered a dwarf planet, but it has not been classified as
                              such yet. Sedna, which is about three-fourths the size of Pluto, is the first dwarf planet

                              If Planet Nine exists, it orbits the sun at a distance that is 20 times farther out than
                              the
                              orbit of Neptune. (The orbit of Neptune is 2.7 billion miles from the sun at its closest
                              point.) The strange world's orbit is about 600 times farther from the sun than the Earth's
                              orbit is from the star. Scientists have not actually seen Planet Nine directly, and some
                              astronomers debate its existence, which was inferred by its gravitational effects on other
                              objects in the Kuiper Belt.

                              Past the Kuiper Belt is the very edge of the solar system, the heliosphere, a vast,
                              teardrop-shaped region of space containing electrically charged particles given off by the
                              sun. Many astronomers think that the limit of the heliosphere, known as the heliopause, is
                              about 9 billion miles (15 billion km) from the sun.

                              The Oort Cloud lies well past the Kuiper Belt, and theoretically extends between 5 and
                              100,000 astronomical units (AU), the distance between the sun and Earth (about 93,000,000
                              miles or 150 million kilometers), and is home to up to 2 trillion icy bodies.

                           <p> Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than
                              Earth’s moon. It is the closest planet to the sun, but it’s actually not the hottest.
                              Venus is hotter.</p>
                           <p>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid
                              surface that is covered with craters. It has no atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons.
                              Mercury likes to keep things simple.</p>

                              <h4>All About Mercury</h4>

                              <p>This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time.
                                 Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast.
                                 Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way
                                 around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived
                                 on
                                 Mercury, you’d have a birthday every three months!</p>

                              <p>A day on Mercury is not like a day here on Earth. For us, the sun rises and sets each
                                 and
                                 every day. Because Mercury has a slow spin and short year, it takes a long time for the
                                 sun to rise and set there. Mercury only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days! Isn't
                                 that
                                 weird?</p>

                                    god.
                                    The Sumerians also knew of Mercury since at least 5,000 years ago. It was often
                                    associated
                                    with Nabu, the god of writing, according to a site connected to NASA's MESSENGER
                                    (Mercury
                                    Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging) mission. Mercury was also

                                    separate names for its appearance as both a morning star and as an evening star.

                                    astronomers knew, however, that the two names referred to the same body, and
                                    Heraclitus,
                                    around 500 B.C., correctly thought that both Mercury and Venus orbited the sun, not
                                    Earth.
                                    Mercury is the second densest planet after Earth, with a huge metallic core roughly
                                    2,200
                                    to 2,400 miles (3,600 to 3,800 kilometers) wide, or about 75% of the planet's
                                    diameter. In
                                    comparison, Mercury's outer shell is only 300 to 400 miles (500 to 600 km) thick.

                              <h4>Mercury`s magnetic field</h4>
                              
                              A completely unexpected discovery made by Mariner 10 was that Mercury possessed a magnetic
                              field. Planets theoretically generate magnetic fields only if they spin quickly and
                              possess a molten core. But Mercury takes 59 days to rotate and is so small — just roughly
                              one-third Earth's size — that its core should have cooled off long ago.

                              "We had figured out how the Earth works, and Mercury is another terrestrial, rocky planet
                              with an iron core, so we thought it would work the same way," Christopher Russell, a
                              professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a statement.

                              An unusual interior could help to explain the differences in Mercury's magnetic field when
                              compared to Earth. Observations from MESSENGER revealed that the planet's magnetic field
                              is approximately three times stronger at its northern hemisphere than at its southern.
                              Russell co-authored a model that suggests that Mercury's iron core may be turning from
                              liquid to solid at the core's outer boundary rather than the inner.

                              "It's like a snow storm in which the snow formed at the top of the cloud and middle of the
                              cloud and the bottom of the cloud too," said Russell. "Our study of Mercury's magnetic
                              field indicates iron is snowing throughout this fluid that is powering Mercury's magnetic
                              field."

                              The discovery in 2007 by Earth-based radar observations that Mercury's core may still be
                              molten could help explain its magnetism, though the solar wind may play a role in
                              dampening the planet's magnetic field.

                              Although Mercury's magnetic field is just 1% the strength of Earth's, it is very active.
                              The magnetic field in the solar wind — the charged particles streaming off the sun —
                              periodically touches upon Mercury's field, creating powerful magnetic tornadoes that
                              channel the fast, hot plasma of the solar wind down to the planet's surface.

                              Mercury speeds around the sun every 88 Earth days, traveling through space at nearly 112,000 mph (180,000 km/h), faster than any other planet. Its oval-shaped orbit is highly elliptical, taking Mercury as close as 29 million miles (47 million km) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million km) from the sun. If one could stand on Mercury when it is nearest to the sun, it would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth.

                              Oddly, due to Mercury's highly elliptical orbit and the 59 Earth-days or so it takes to rotate on its axis, when on the scorching surface of the planet, the sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again before it travels westward across the sky. At sunset, the sun appears to set, rise again briefly, and then set again.
                              
                              In 2016, a rare transit of Mercury happened, where the planet crossed the face of the sun as seen from Earth. Mercury's transit may have yielded secrets about its thin atmosphere, assisted in the hunt for worlds around other stars, and helped NASA hone some of its instruments.

                             <h4>RESEARCH & EXPLORATION</h4> 
                              The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was Mariner 10, which imaged about 45% of the surface and detected its magnetic field.
                              
                              NASA's MESSENGER orbiter was the second spacecraft to visit Mercury. When it arrived in March 2011, it became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet. The mission came to an abrupt end on April 30, 2015, when the spacecraft, which had run out of fuel, purposely crashed onto the planet's surface for scientists to observe the results.
                              
                              In 2012, scientists discovered a group of meteorites in Morocco that they think could have originated from the planet Mercury. If so, it would make the rocky planet a member of a very select club with samples available on Earth; only the moon, Mars and the large asteroid Vesta have verified rocks in human laboratories.

                              In 2016, scientists released the first-ever global digital-elevation model of Mercury, which combined more than 10,000 images acquired by MESSENGER to take viewers across the wide-open spaces of the tiny world. The model revealed the planet's highest and lowest points — the highest is found just south of Mercury's equator, sitting 2.78 miles (4.48 km) above the average elevation of the planet, while the lowest point resides in Rachmaninoff basin, the suspected home of some of the most recent volcanic activity on the planet, and lies 3.34 miles (5.38 km) below the landscape average.
                              
                              In 2018, a new Mercury explorer launched, the BepiColombo mission jointly operated by the European and Japanese space agencies. BepiColombo is composed of two spacecraft that, after a long trek to Mercury, will split up to better understand the tiny world. The European Space Agency's segment of the mission will focus on studying Mercury's surface while the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's portion will focus on the planet's strange magnetosphere.
                              
                              Currently, the mission is trekking through the inner solar system, with Mercury flybys to fine-tune the spacecraft's mission beginning later this year. The proper science mission will begin in 2025 and is scheduled to last for about one Earth year, or four Mercury years.

                           <p> Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.
                              And
                              its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because
                              it's so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all
                              the way around the Sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on
                              Venus.
                           </p>

                           <p> Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth.
                              Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth
                              days.
                              That means the Sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the
                              same day on Venus! And because Venus rotates backwards, the Sun rises in the west and sets
                              in
                              the east.</p>

                           thick atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid.
                           The gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like
                           lead would be puddles of melted liquid.
                           Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in
                           size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.</p>

                              Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface
                              with
                              mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an
                              ocean
                              planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface. </p>

                           <p> Since we live here, you might think we know all there is to know about Earth. Not at all,
                              actually! We have a lot we can learn about our home planet. Right now, there are many
                              satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures and measurements. This is how we can learn more
                              about weather, oceans, soil, climate change, and many other important topics.</p>

                        <p>Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The
                           atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our
                           atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.</p>


                        <br>

                        <ul>
                           <li> Earth is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.
                           </li>
                           <li>Earth's atmosphere is the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like
                              us
                              can be there. It’s the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It
                              is
                              mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.</li>

                           <li>One year on Earth lasts 365.25 days. That 0.25 extra means every four years we need to
                              add
                              one day to our calendar. We call it a leap day (in a leap year).</li>

                           <li>Earth has lots of spacecraft watching it. There is still a lot we can learn about our
                              home
                              planet.</li>
                           <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. That means Venus and Mars are
                              Earth’s neighboring planets.</li>

                              place
                              in the solar system for a long time.</li>

                           Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red
                           Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.

                        Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got
                        massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like
                        the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and
                        doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth.
                        Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.

                        <p>
                           Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones.
                           The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of
                           chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was
                           seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we
                           know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.

                              Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its
                              atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has
                              methane.
                              The methane makes Uranus blue.

                           <p> Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are
                              brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction
                              as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.

                              the atmosphere. Green and blue areas show where the atmosphere is clear and sunlight can
                              get through. The yellow and grey parts have thicker clouds. Orange and red colors mean
                              very high clouds, similar to cirrus clouds on Earth.

                              Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system.
                              It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is.
                           </p>

                              Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane
                              over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
                              The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but
                              they're very hard to see.

                        <ul>
                           <li>Neptune is encircled by six rings.</li>
                           <li>Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant. It’s similar to a gas giant. It is made of a thick
                              soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing over a solid core about the size of Earth.
                           </li>
                           <li>Neptune has a thick, windy atmosphere.</li>

                           <li>Neptune has such a long journey around the Sun it takes 165 Earth years to go around
                              once. That’s a long year!</li>

                           <li>Neptune has 13 moons (and one more awaiting confirmation of discovery).</li>
                           <li>Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet from the Sun. That means Uranus is
                              Neptune’s only neighboring planet.</li>

                           <li>Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Urbain Le Verrier, John Couch Adams, and Johann Galle.
                           </li>
                           <li>Only Voyager 2 has visited Neptune.</li>
