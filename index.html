                           The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and working outward is
                           the following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and then the
                           possible Planet Nine.

                           Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning that the solar system has
                           nine planets. That all changed in the late 1990s when astronomers started arguing about
                           whether Pluto was indeed a planet. In a highly controversial decision, the International
                           Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to designate Pluto as a "dwarf planet,"
                           reducing the list of the solar system's true planets to just eight.

                           If you insist on including Pluto, it would come after Neptune on the list. Pluto is truly way
                           out there and on a wildly tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it was
                           demoted).

                        <br>
                        <p>
                           Astronomers, however, are still hunting for another possible planet in our solar system, a
                           true ninth planet, after mathematical evidence of its existence was revealed on Jan. 20,
                           2016. The alleged "Planet Nine," also called "Planet X," is believed to be about 10 times the
                           mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.

                           The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it, including
                           planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. It extends from the sun, called Sol by the
                           ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner planets, through the Asteroid Belt to the four
                           gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the teardrop-shaped
                           heliopause. Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion miles
                           (15 billion kilometers) from the sun. Beyond the heliopause lies the giant, spherical Oort
                           Cloud, which is thought to surround the solar system.

                        <h4>HOW WAS THE SOLAR SYSTEM DISCOVERED?</h4> 
                        <p>
                          
For millennia, astronomers have followed points of light that seemed to move among the stars. The ancient Greeks named them planets, meaning "wanderers." Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were known in antiquity, and the invention of the telescope added the Asteroid Belt, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and many of these worlds' moons. The dawn of the space age saw dozens of probes launched to explore our system, an adventure that continues today. 

There have been five human-made objects so far, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, New Horizons, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, that have crossed the threshold into interstellar space.

                        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest since Pluto was downgraded to a dwarf
                        planet. It is also one of five planets visible by the naked eye, along with Saturn, Jupiter,
                        Mars,
                        and Venus. Despite its proximity to Earth, Mercury is among the least explored planets due to
                        its
                        proximity to the Sun. Nevertheless, researchers do not expect life to exist on the planet due to
                        its unconducive environment.

                                 It takes Mercury 176 Earth days to complete a rotation around its axis and 88 days to
                                 complete a revolution around the Sun, meaning that a day is longer than its year.
                                 Mercury and
                                 the Sun are nearly in a tidal lock, which has slowed the planet's rotation.
                                 Additionally,
                                 Mercury has the greatest orbital eccentricity, ranging from 29 million mi to 43 million
                                 mi.

                                 Mercury revolves around the Sun at 112,000 mph, which is the fastest of all planets.

                                 orbit is immensely elliptical, as its distance from the Sun varies between 29 million
                                 mi and
                                 43 million mi. The elliptical orbit also influences its visibility from Earth, as it
                                 can move
                                 between clear visibility or not be visible at all.

                              <h4> Difficult To Spot In The Sky</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Mercury plays peekaboo with the Sun, as the planet rises and sets close to when the Sun
                                 does,
                                 which can make it challenging to see it in the sky. Ironically, the planet's existence
                                 was
                                 documented by ancient astronomers before the discovery of Venus and Mars. Current
                                 astronomers
                                 believe that the darker skies of the past made it possible for ancient astronomers to
                                 see
                                 Mercury.

                              <p>
                                 Mercury and Venus are the only two planets in the Solar System without either a moon or
                                 ring.
                                 Astronomers believe that in the past, both planets had moons, but that the Sun’s
                                 immense
                                 gravity pulled them away. Moons offer a better understanding of the formation of
                                 planets, and
                                 the lack of a moon leaves certain questions unanswered.

                              <h4>Second Hottest Planet</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Mercury may be the closest planet to the Sun, but it is not as hot as Venus. Mercury
                                 has a
                                 light atmosphere that allows heat to escape, unlike Venus, which has a dense atmosphere
                                 that
                                 traps the heat. The side of Mercury that faces the Sun experiences temperatures of
                                 approximately 427 °C, while the alternate side can be as cold as -173 °C. Venus has an
                                 average temperature of 427 °C, as its dense atmosphere circulates heat evenly
                                 throughout the
                                 planet.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Molten Core</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Recent studies show that Mercury indeed has a molten core, which is contrary to the
                                 solid
                                 iron core theory proposed throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. The cores of
                                 smaller
                                 planets cool and solidify rapidly, but extensive research concludes that this is not
                                 the case
                                 for Mercury. Researchers believe that the core is made up of lighter materials that
                                 have
                                 lower melting points, such as sulfur.

                              <h4>Mercury Has Organic Material And Water Ice</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Surprisingly, given its proximity to the hot Sun, Mercury contains water ice. However,
                                 this
                                 ice is located within permanently shadowed craters that do not receive sunlight
                                 throughout
                                 the year. Organic materials, which are the building blocks of life, have also been
                                 discovered, but the harsh conditions on Mercury cannot support life as it exists on
                                 Earth.
                                 The concentration of sulfur on Mercury is unlike any other planet in the Solar System.

                              <h4>The Most Cratered Planet</h4>
                              <p>
                                 While other planets "self-heal" after collisions with comets and asteroids, Mercury
                                 does not,
                                 which has led to numerous craters on the planet's surface. Most are small craters,
                                 while a
                                 few are more than 50 mi wide. The largest crater is the Caloris Basin, which has a
                                 diameter
                                 of 963 mi.
                              </p>

                              <h4>Two Probes Have Visited Mercury</h4>
                              <p>
                                 It is challenging to travel between Earth and Mercury not only because the closest
                                 distance
                                 between the two planets is over 48 million mi, but also due to the immense temperature
                                 from
                                 the Sun. Only two probes have reached Mercury: NASA's Mariner 10in 1974-75 and NASA's
                                 MESSENGER in 2004. In 2018, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Aerospace
                                 Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the joint BepiColombomission that is expected to
                                 reach the
                                 orbit of Mercury in December 2025.
                              </p>

                              <h4>Changing Atmosphere</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Mercury has a fragile atmosphere known as an exosphere. It is unable to retain heat,
                                 which is
                                 why the dark side of the planet is frigid. Research shows that the concentration of
                                 magnesium, sodium, and calcium in Mercury’s atmosphere fluctuates depending on its
                                 distance
                                 from the Sun. Although there is no conclusive evidence regarding why this occurs,
                                 astronomers
                                 link it to solar radiation pressure.
