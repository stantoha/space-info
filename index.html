                           The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and
                           working outward is
                           the following: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and
                           then the
                           possible Planet Nine.

                           Ever since the discovery of Pluto in 1930, kids grew up learning that the solar
                           system has
                           nine planets. That all changed in the late 1990s when astronomers started arguing
                           about
                           whether Pluto was indeed a planet. In a highly controversial decision, the
                           International
                           Astronomical Union ultimately decided in 2006 to designate Pluto as a "dwarf
                           planet,"
                           reducing the list of the solar system's true planets to just eight.

                           If you insist on including Pluto, it would come after Neptune on the list. Pluto
                           is truly way
                           out there and on a wildly tilted, elliptical orbit (two of the several reasons it
                           was
                           demoted).

                           Astronomers, however, are still hunting for another possible planet in our solar
                           system, a
                           true ninth planet, after mathematical evidence of its existence was revealed on Jan.

                           2016. The alleged "Planet Nine," also called "Planet X," is believed to be about 10
                           times the
                           mass of Earth and 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.

                           The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it, including
                           planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. It extends from the sun, called Sol by the
                           ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner planets, through the Asteroid Belt to the four
                           gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the teardrop-shaped
                           heliopause. Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion miles
                           (15 billion kilometers) from the sun. Beyond the heliopause lies the giant, spherical Oort
                           Cloud, which is thought to surround the solar system.

                        <h4>HOW WAS THE SOLAR SYSTEM DISCOVERED?</h4>
                        <p>

                           For millennia, astronomers have followed points of light that seemed to move among the stars.
                           The ancient Greeks named them planets, meaning "wanderers." Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and
                           Saturn were known in antiquity, and the invention of the telescope added the Asteroid Belt,
                           Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and many of these worlds' moons. The dawn of the space age saw dozens
                           of probes launched to explore our system, an adventure that continues today.

                           There have been five human-made objects so far, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, New Horizons, Pioneer
                           10 and Pioneer 11, that have crossed the threshold into interstellar space.
                           The discovery of Eris kicked off a rash of new discoveries of dwarf planets, and eventually
                           led to the International Astronomical Union revising the definition of a "planet." The
                           revision changed Pluto's status from planet to dwarf planet in 2006, a decision that remains
                           controversial – especially after the New Horizons mission found immense geological variety on
                           the world in 2015.

                           Astronomers are now hunting for another planet in our solar system, a true ninth planet,
                           after evidence of its existence was unveiled on Jan. 20, 2016. The so-called "Planet Nine,"
                           as scientists are calling it, is about 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun as close
                           as 200 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance from Earth to the sun — about 93
                           million miles (150 million km).

                        <h4>HOW DID THE SOLAR SYSTEM FORM?</h4>
                        <p>

                           Many scientists think our solar system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust
                           known as the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and
                           flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.
                           Other particles within the disk collided and stuck together to form asteroid-sized objects
                           named as planetesimals, some of which combined to become the asteroids, comets, moons and
                           planets.

                           The solar wind from the sun was so powerful that it swept away most of the lighter elements,
                           such as hydrogen and helium, from the innermost planets, leaving behind mostly small, rocky
                           worlds. The solar wind was much weaker in the outer regions, however, resulting in gas giants
                           made up mostly of hydrogen and helium.

                           THE SUN
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                           The sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of the solar
                           system's mass. It sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth and
                           possibly elsewhere. Planets orbit the sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with the sun
                           slightly off-center of each ellipse. NASA has a fleet of spacecraft observing the sun, such
                           as the Parker Solar Probe, to learn more about its composition, and to make better
                           predictions about solar activity and its effect on Earth.

                           INNER SOLAR SYSTEM
                        </h4>
                        <p>

                           The four inner four planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars — are made up mostly of iron and
                           rock. They are known as terrestrial or earth-like planets because of their similar size and
                           composition. Earth has one natural satellite — the moon — and Mars has two moons — Deimos and
                           Phobos.

                           Between Mars and Jupiter lies the Asteroid Belt. Asteroids are minor planets, and scientists
                           estimate there are more than 750,000 of them with diameters larger than three-fifths of a
                           mile (1 km) and millions of smaller asteroids. The dwarf planet Ceres, about 590 miles (950
                           km) in diameter, resides here. A number of asteroids have orbits that take them closer into
                           the solar system that sometimes lead them to collide with Earth or the other inner planets.

                           Earth is surrounded by a flotilla of spacecraft, and Mars has been visited by many spacecraft
                           as well. Some of the more prominent Martian missions include the Perseverance rover, InSight
                           lander, Tianwen-1 rover, Curiosity rover, the Opportunity and Spirit rovers, the Mars
                           Reconnaissance Orbiter (which takes high-resolution pictures from orbit) and the Viking
                           landers and rovers.
                           Venus has been explored by American, European and Soviet spacecraft, such as Venera 13 over
                           the decades. NASA announced in June 2021 that it will launch two missions to Venus by 2030 -
                           an orbiter called VERITAS and an atmospheric probe called DAVINCI+.

                           Mercury has been host to several flybys and two-long term missions: MESSENGER (now concluded)
                           and BepiColombo.

                        <h4>OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM</h4>

                        <p>
                           The outer planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — are giant worlds with thick outer
                           layers of gas. Between these planets, they have dozens of moons with a variety of
                           compositions, ranging from rocky to icy to even volcanic (such as in the case of Jupiter's
                           Io.) Nearly all the planets' mass is made up of hydrogen and helium, giving them compositions
                           like that of the sun. Beneath these outer layers, they have no solid surfaces — the pressure
                           from their thick atmospheres liquefy their insides, although they might have rocky cores.
                           Rings of dust, rock, and ice encircle all these giants, with Saturn's being the most famous.

                           Comets are often known as dirty snowballs, and consist mainly of ice and rock. When a comet's
                           orbit takes it close to the sun, some of the ice in its central nucleus turns into gas that
                           shoots out of the comet's sunlit side, which the solar wind carries outward to form into a
                           long tail. Short-period comets that complete their orbits in less than 200 years are thought
                           to originate from the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt, while long-period comets that take more than
                           200 years to return are thought to come from the spherical Oort Cloud.

                           Jupiter and Saturn have each been visited by several spacecraft, and were also host to
                           long-term missions including Juno and Galileo at Jupiter, and Cassini at Saturn. Uranus and
                           Neptune, however, have only been seen during one spacecraft flyby — that of Voyager 2 in the
                           1980s. Some scientists are working on creating a Uranus or Neptune orbiter to fly there in
                           the 2030s or so. Scientists do observations from the ground as well, to track the long-term
                           changes in weather and cloud formations in the gas giants.

                           <h4>TRANS-NEPTUNIAN REGION</h4>

                           Astronomers had long suspected that a band of icy material known as the Kuiper Belt existed
                           past the orbit of Neptune extending from about 30 to 55 times the distance of Earth to the
                           sun, and from the last decade of the 20th century up to now, they have found more than a
                           thousand of such objects. Scientists estimate the Kuiper Belt is likely home to hundreds of
                           thousands of icy bodies larger than 60 miles (100 km) wide, as well as an estimated trillion
                           or more comets.

                           Pluto, now considered a dwarf planet, dwells in the Kuiper Belt. It is not alone — recent
                           additions include Makemake, Haumea and Eris. Another Kuiper Belt object dubbed Quaoar is
                           probably massive enough to be considered a dwarf planet, but it has not been classified as
                           such yet. Sedna, which is about three-fourths the size of Pluto, is the first dwarf planet
                           discovered in the Oort Cloud. NASA's New Horizons mission performed history's first flyby of
                           the Pluto system on July 14, 2015.

                           If Planet Nine exists, it orbits the sun at a distance that is 20 times farther out than the
                           orbit of Neptune. (The orbit of Neptune is 2.7 billion miles from the sun at its closest
                           point.) The strange world's orbit is about 600 times farther from the sun than the Earth's
                           orbit is from the star. Scientists have not actually seen Planet Nine directly, and some
                           astronomers debate its existence, which was inferred by its gravitational effects on other
                           objects in the Kuiper Belt.

                           <h5>Related: What if Planet Nine is a baby black hole?</h5>

                           Past the Kuiper Belt is the very edge of the solar system, the heliosphere, a vast,
                           teardrop-shaped region of space containing electrically charged particles given off by the
                           sun. Many astronomers think that the limit of the heliosphere, known as the heliopause, is
                           about 9 billion miles (15 billion km) from the sun.

                           The Oort Cloud lies well past the Kuiper Belt, and theoretically extends between 5 and
                           100,000 astronomical units (AU), the distance between the sun and Earth (about 93,000,000
                           miles or 150 million kilometers), and is home to up to 2 trillion icy bodies.

                        <p>
                           It takes Mercury 176 Earth days to complete a rotation around its axis and 88 days to
                           complete a revolution around the Sun, meaning that a day is longer than its year.
                           Mercury and
                           the Sun are nearly in a tidal lock, which has slowed the planet's rotation.
                           Additionally,
                           Mercury has the greatest orbital eccentricity, ranging from 29 million mi to 43 million
                           mi.

                        <h4>Mercury’s Unique Orbit</h4>
                        <p>
                           Mercury revolves around the Sun at 112,000 mph, which is the fastest of all planets.
                           Its
                           orbit is immensely elliptical, as its distance from the Sun varies between 29 million
                           mi and
                           43 million mi. The elliptical orbit also influences its visibility from Earth, as it
                           can move
                           between clear visibility or not be visible at all.

                        <h4> Difficult To Spot In The Sky</h4>
                        <p>
                           Mercury plays peekaboo with the Sun, as the planet rises and sets close to when the Sun
                           does,
                           which can make it challenging to see it in the sky. Ironically, the planet's existence
                           was
                           documented by ancient astronomers before the discovery of Venus and Mars. Current
                           astronomers
                           believe that the darker skies of the past made it possible for ancient astronomers to
                           see
                           Mercury.

                        <h4>Mercury Has No Rings Or Moons</h4>
                        <p>
                           Mercury and Venus are the only two planets in the Solar System without either a moon or
                           ring.
                           Astronomers believe that in the past, both planets had moons, but that the Sun’s
                           immense
                           gravity pulled them away. Moons offer a better understanding of the formation of
                           planets, and
                           the lack of a moon leaves certain questions unanswered.

                        <h4>Second Hottest Planet</h4>
                        <p>
                           Mercury may be the closest planet to the Sun, but it is not as hot as Venus. Mercury
                           has a
                           light atmosphere that allows heat to escape, unlike Venus, which has a dense atmosphere
                           that
                           traps the heat. The side of Mercury that faces the Sun experiences temperatures of
                           approximately 427 °C, while the alternate side can be as cold as -173 °C. Venus has an
                           average temperature of 427 °C, as its dense atmosphere circulates heat evenly
                           throughout the
                           planet.

                        <br>
                        <h4>Molten Core</h4>
                        <p>
                           Recent studies show that Mercury indeed has a molten core, which is contrary to the
                           solid
                           iron core theory proposed throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. The cores of
                           smaller
                           planets cool and solidify rapidly, but extensive research concludes that this is not
                           the case
                           for Mercury. Researchers believe that the core is made up of lighter materials that
                           have
                           lower melting points, such as sulfur.

                        <br>
                        <h4>Mercury Has Organic Material And Water Ice</h4>
                        <p>
                           Surprisingly, given its proximity to the hot Sun, Mercury contains water ice. However,
                           this
                           ice is located within permanently shadowed craters that do not receive sunlight
                           throughout
                           the year. Organic materials, which are the building blocks of life, have also been
                           discovered, but the harsh conditions on Mercury cannot support life as it exists on
                           Earth.
                           The concentration of sulfur on Mercury is unlike any other planet in the Solar System.

                        <h4>The Most Cratered Planet</h4>
                        <p>
                           While other planets "self-heal" after collisions with comets and asteroids, Mercury
                           does not,
                           which has led to numerous craters on the planet's surface. Most are small craters,
                           while a
                           few are more than 50 mi wide. The largest crater is the Caloris Basin, which has a
                           diameter
                           of 963 mi.

                        <br>
                        <h4>Two Probes Have Visited Mercury</h4>
                        <p>
                           It is challenging to travel between Earth and Mercury not only because the closest
                           distance
                           between the two planets is over 48 million mi, but also due to the immense temperature
                           from
                           the Sun. Only two probes have reached Mercury: NASA's Mariner 10in 1974-75 and NASA's
                           MESSENGER in 2004. In 2018, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japanese Aerospace
                           Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the joint BepiColombomission that is expected to
                           reach the
                           orbit of Mercury in December 2025.

                        <h4>Changing Atmosphere</h4>
                        <p>
                           Mercury has a fragile atmosphere known as an exosphere. It is unable to retain heat,
                           which is
                           why the dark side of the planet is frigid. Research shows that the concentration of
                           magnesium, sodium, and calcium in Mercury’s atmosphere fluctuates depending on its
                           distance
                           from the Sun. Although there is no conclusive evidence regarding why this occurs,
                           astronomers
                           link it to solar radiation pressure.

                        <h4> All About Venus</h4>
                        <p>
                           Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the Sun, it is still the hottest. It has a
                           thick atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid.
                           The gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like
                           lead would be puddles of melted liquid.
                           Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in
                           size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.

                           <p>
                              Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.
                              And
                              its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because
                              it's so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all
                              the way around the Sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on
                              Venus.

                              Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth.
                              Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth
                              days.
                              That means the Sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the
                              same day on Venus! And because Venus rotates backwards, the Sun rises in the west and sets
                              in
                              the east.

                              Just like Mercury, Venus doesn't have any moons.

                              Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system.
                              Venus is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.
                              Venus has a thick atmosphere. It traps heat and makes Venus very hot.
                              Venus has an active surface, including volcanoes!
                              Venus spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.

                           Venus is the second planet from the Sun. That means Mercury and Earth are Venus's neighboring

                           Venus has been known since ancient times because it can be seen easily without a telescope.
                           Venus has been visited by several spacecraft: Mariner 2, Mariner 5, Mariner 10, Pioneer Venus
                           1, Pioneer Venus 2, and an orbiter called Magellan.

                           All About Earth
                           Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with
                           mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean
                           planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface. </p>
                        <p>Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The
                           atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our
                           atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.

                           Since we live here, you might think we know all there is to know about Earth. Not at all,
                           actually! We have a lot we can learn about our home planet. Right now, there are many
                           satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures and measurements. This is how we can learn more
                           about weather, oceans, soil, climate change, and many other important topics.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4> Structure and Surface</h4>
                        <p> Earth is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.
                           Earth's atmosphere is the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like us
                           can be there. It’s the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It is
                           mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.</p>

                           A day on Earth lasts a little under 24 hours.
                           One year on Earth lasts 365.25 days. That 0.25 extra means every four years we need to add
                           one day to our calendar. We call it a leap day (in a leap year).
                        </p>

                           Earth has lots of spacecraft watching it. There is still a lot we can learn about our home
                           planet.
                           Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. That means Venus and Mars are

                        <h4>All About Mars</h4>
                        <p>
                           Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red
                           Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very
                           thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.

                           There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin
                           clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.

                           Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to
                           know if Mars could support life now or in the future.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h4> Structure and Surface</h4>
                        <p> Mars is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.
                           Mars has a thin atmosphere.
                           Mars has an active atmosphere, but the surface of the planet is not active. Its volcanoes are
                           dead.</p>

                        <h4>Time on Mars</h4>

                        <p>
                           One day on Mars lasts 24.6 hours. It is just a little longer than a day on Earth.
                           One year on Mars is 687 Earth days. It is almost twice as long as one year on Earth.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Earth’s Neighbors</h4>
                        <p> Earth has just one Moon. It is the only planet to have just one moon.
                           Earth has lots of spacecraft watching it. There is still a lot we can learn about our home
                           planet.
                           Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. That means Venus and Mars are
                           Earth’s neighboring planets.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Quick History</h4>
                        <p> Mars has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes.
                           Several missions have visited Mars. And Mars is the only planet we have sent rovers to. They
                           drive around Mars, taking pictures and measurements.</p>

                        Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got
                        massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like
                        the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and
                        doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth.
                        Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.

                           Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones.
                           The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of
                           chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was
                           seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we
                           know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.

Его влияние простирается далеко за пределы орбит Нептуна и Плутона. Без Солнца и его интенсивной энергии и тепла, не было бы жизни на Земле. Существуют миллиарды звезд, как наше Солнце, разбросанных по галактике Млечный Путь.</p></li><li><h3 id="mercury"><span id="i-2" class="last">Меркурий</span></h3><p class="last">Выжженный Солнцем Меркурий лишь немного больше, чем спутник Земли Луна. Подобно Луне, Меркурий практически лишен атмосферы и не может сгладить следы воздействия от падения метеоритов, поэтому он как и Луна покрыт кратерами. Дневная сторона Меркурия очень сильно нагревается на Солнце, а на ночной стороне температура падает на сотни градусов ниже нуля. В кратерах Меркурия, которые расположены на полюсах, существует лед. Меркурий совершает один оборот вокруг Солнца за 88 дней.</p></li><li><h3 id="venus"><span id="i-3" class="last">Венера</span></h3><p class="last">Венера это мир чудовищной жары (еще больше чем на Меркурии) и вулканической активности. Аналогичная по структуре и размеру Земле, Венера покрыта толстой и токсичной атмосферой, которая создает сильный парниковый эффект. Этот выжженной мир достаточно горячий, чтобы расплавить свинец. Радарные снимки сквозь могучую атмосферу выявили вулканы и деформированные горы. Венера вращается в противоположном направлении, от вращения большинства планет.</p></li><li><h3 id="earth"><span id="i-4" class="last">Земля</span></h3><p class="last">Земля — планета океан. Наш дом, с его обилием воды и жизни делает его уникальным в нашей Солнечной системе. Другие планеты, в том числе несколько лун, также имеют залежи льда, атмосферу, времена года и даже погоду, но только на Земле все эти компоненты собрались вместе таким образом, что стало возможным существование жизнь.</p></li><li><h3 id="mars"><span id="i-5" class="last">Марс</span></h3><p class="last">Хотя детали поверхности Марса трудно увидеть с Земли, наблюдения в телескоп показывают, что на Марсе существуют сезоны и белые пятна на полюсах. В течение многих десятилетий, люди полагали, что яркие и темные области на Марсе это пятна растительности и что Марс может быть подходящим местом для жизни, и что вода существует в полярных шапках. Когда космический аппарат Маринер-4, прилетел у Марсу в 1965 году, многие из ученых были потрясены, увидев фотографии мрачной планеты покрытой кратерами. Марс оказался мертвой планетой. Более поздние миссии, однако, показали, что Марс хранит множество тайн, которые еще предстоит решить.</p></li><li><h3 id="jupiter"><span id="i-6" class="last">Юпитер</span></h3><p class="last">Юпитер — самая массивная планета в нашей Солнечной системе, имеет четыре больших спутника и множество небольших лун. Юпитер образует своего рода миниатюрную Солнечную систему. Чтобы превратится в полноценную звезду, Юпитеру нужно было стать в 80 раз массивнее.</p></li><li><h3 id="saturn"><span id="i-7" class="last">Сатурн</span></h3><p class="last">Сатурн — самая дальняя из пяти планет, которые были известны до изобретения телескопа. Подобно Юпитеру, Сатурн состоит в основном из водорода и гелия. Его объем в 755 раз больше, чем у Земли. Ветры в его атмосфере достигают скорости 500 метров в секунду. Эти быстрые ветра в сочетании с теплом, поднимающимся из недр планеты, вызывают появление желтых и золотистых полос, которые мы видим в атмосфере.</p></li><li><h3 id="uranus"><span id="i-8" class="last">Уран</span></h3><p class="last">Первая планета найденная с помощью телескопа, Уран был открыт в 1781 году астрономом Уильямом Гершелем. Седьмая планета от Солнца настолько далека, что один оборот вокруг Солнца занимает 84 года.</p></li><li><h3 id="neptune"><span id="i-9" class="last">Нептун</span></h3><p class="last">Почти в 4,5 млрд. километрах от Солнца вращается далекий Нептун. На один оборот вокруг Солнца у него уходит 165 лет. Он невидим невооруженным глазом из-за его огромного расстояния от Земли. Интересно, что его необычная эллиптическая орбита, пересекается с орбитой карликовой планеты Плутона из-за чего Плутон находится внутри орбиты Нептуна порядка 20 лет из 248 за которые совершает один оборот вокруг Солнца.</p></li><li class="last"><h3 id="pluto"><span id="i-10" class="last">Плутон</span></h3><p class="last">Крошечный, холодный и невероятно далекий Плутон был открыт в 1930 году и долго считался девятой планетой. Но после открытий подобных Плутону миров, которые находились еще дальше, Плутон был переведен в категорию карликовых планет в 2006 году.</p></li></ul></section>
